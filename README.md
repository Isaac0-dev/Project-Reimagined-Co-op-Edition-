Welcome to the repository of Project Reimagined! Specifically the sm64ex-coop port of the hack.

## What is this all about?

Project Reimagined aims to bring together some of the coolest Reimaginings of classic Super Mario 64 Levels! From Hacks like B3313, Super Mario 64: Openworld Quest, and more!

The goal is to have 170 stars, spanning multiple levels, free to be played alone or with your friends (and everyone else).

###### Bug Reporting

If coding is not your thing, you can also test the hack and report any bug you find, the more you find, the more polished this hack can be.
